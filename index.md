This blog will attempt to convey my brain's random blurbs about programming with C#, .NET, Unity, and related tools.

I may also throw in occasional game reviews, because I play a __lot__ of games, and that seems like a good way to justify all that time.

And if I ever get my store page up, that may be somehow integrated here as well. That site will be called _Vault357.com_. For now, that link will take you to my eBay sellers page, where I usually have some goodies available for sale.
